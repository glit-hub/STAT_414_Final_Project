# STAT_414_Final_Project

Our Question:
 How did income level affect ratio of women to men who enroll in secondary education from 1999-2005? We will answer this question using GDP and demographic data, looking at the general change, change by region, change by income group of a country, and change by large country. The hypothesis is that higher income countries will have a higher ratio of women to men who enroll in secondary education. The data we will be looking at is from the world bank (income) and UN data (enrollment in secondary education).
